## Forecasting Global Surface Temperature 
## ARIMA ERROR - 2.264%
## SARIMA ERROR - 4.643%

- The data for the Average Global Surface Temperature time series is analyzed and forecasted in this research.
- There are two types of ARIMA models: basic ARIMA and trend based ARIMA. We utilized simple ARIMA to forecast the world average temperature.
- It has been discovered that the Trend based ARIMA approach outperformed the basic ARIMA method among all linear models. 
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MSE (Mean Squared Error) have all been used to evaluate the model's accuracy.
- The primary goal of this study is to create a low-cost, trustworthy, and efficient weather forecast model that may be used in our daily life. 
- The importance of forecasting the weather conditions and its different patterns is observed using time series analysis.
- In forecasting the model, ARIMA is a really helpful and widely used statistical method. 
- These studies may have certain limits due to a variety of factors such as a huge dataset, missing data, harsh circumstances, extreme conditions and so on.
- The acquired findings were compared to the test data set prepared in combination with the training data and determined to be satisfactory given the minimal amount of data available for training and testing. 
- A bigger data collection, consisting of data collected over several decades, will be required to achieve a better result.
